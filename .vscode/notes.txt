look at the server file
find out why are you declaring and extending the express.req object in the template( current project has implementation like in socket.d.ts)
from this endpoint "/verify/:code",
remove "insertDevice" because user is never authenticated, so this inserts device info without user info

use resErrorHandler every where( no no just create one responseHandler() use it for both success/error calls )
rate limiter( throttle.middleware , conneciton.config is also modified)
io stuff ( session, user id population, socket.middleware.ts )
switch to postgres
